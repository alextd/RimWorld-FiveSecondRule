	<description>Deteriorated food/items that work just as well as full HP don't sell for less.
	
Now, this is crudely done by setting their HP to full if placed under an indoor roof.

But their HP literally affects nothing other than market value. Why would traders get a discount on a low HP thing that works just the same at max HP?


Okay, maybe if a fire breaks out, not as many items will be destroyed. That is a case I'm not worried about.</description>
